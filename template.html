      <h3>Mailing lists, Emails</h3>
    </hgroup><br>

      <li>Most open source organizations use IRC and/or mailing lists to communicate with one another</li>
      <li>A mailing list is simply a list of addresses to which the same information is being sent</li>
      <li>They are used to allow a group of people to discuss topics amongst themselves, with everyone able to send mail to the list and have it distributed to everyone in the group</li>
    </ul>

  <slide>
    <hgroup>
      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <h3>IRC(Internet Relay Chat)</h3>
    </hgroup><br>
    <ul>
      <li>IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is basically a giant chat room for a community that can have anywhere from 1 to hundreds of users</li>
      <li>Most open source organizations use IRC as their main form of communication</li>
      <li>It is a great way for someone to pose a general question and for anyone who is logged on to answer the question </li>
      <li>IRC Clients: HexCHat, Pidgin etc.</li>
    </ul>

  <slide>
    <hgroup>
      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <h3>Etiquette for mailing lists, emails, IRC, etc</h3>
    </hgroup><br>
    <ul>
      <li>keep the following items in mind when communicating with your mentors, community members and other students this will help make a positive, professional impression with the community:
        <ul>
          <li>NEVER SHOUT! Using all capital letters is the same as screaming and is never looked upon favorably in email, forums or IRC</li>
          <li>Be considerate. When you are asking for help, being rude or pushy will rarely get you an answer to your question. It  will also cause people to immediately have a negative response to you, not something you ever want</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </slide>

  <slide>
    <hgroup>
      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <h3>When and how to ask questions</h3>
    </hgroup><br>
    <ul>
      <li>If you have a question ask it early on, don’t wait until you are frustrated before asking your mentor to clarify something.  "Ask questions early and often."</li>
      <li>The fastest way to get a response about a question is to use the IRC channel or the mailing list of your organization</li>
      <li>Keep in mind that mentors are volunteers, they have regular jobs too, they are not expected to be available 24/7</li>
      <li>Please allow up to 36 hours for a response</li>
      <li>Your mentor will receive notification once you have submitted your task for review in Melange. There is no need to continue sending reminders that your task is ready for review</li>
    </ul>

      <h2>Knowledge</h2>
    </hgroup><br>
    <h3>Version control systems</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A version control system (also known as a Revision Control System) is a repository of files, often the files for the source code of computer programs, with monitored access.</li>
      <li>You might want to read up on the user guides for the version control system your project uses before trying to commit your code or patch</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Specific Technologies</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If you're going to take on coding tasks, you should be comfortable using the basics of at least one coding language (C, C++, Python, Java, Javascript, Go, etc.)</li>
      <li>If you aren’t completely confident in your skills, you may wish to start with a documentation task which can help you become more comfortable with the code</li>
